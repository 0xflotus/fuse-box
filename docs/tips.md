# Tips

below are some tips that will improve your experience and help you  avoiding gotchas while using **FuseBox**.

## General
* Don't import **FuseBox** in your code, it will cause issues, it is already added to your bundle.
* Use the `EnvPlugin` to pass Environmental variables on both client and server, you can even use packages like [safe-env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/safe-env) with it.

## TypeScript
* Make sure to always add the extension to your required or imported file as **TypeScript** requires it.
